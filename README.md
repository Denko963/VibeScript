# üåä VibeScript

> **Code is dead. Vibes are forever.** 

VibeScript is the **world‚Äôs first prompt-driven, component-based, full-stack, AI-powered, vibe-oriented programming language**.

You don‚Äôt write code. You write *vibes*.  
VibeScript compiles your vibes into production-ready HTML/CSS/JS using an LLM, caches the results, and serves them like a normal website.  

It‚Äôs like React, but instead of JSX, you just say:

```
component Navbar:
    "A minimalistic navbar with a logo on the left and a glowing 'Sign Up' button on the right."
```

## üèÜ Why Use VibeScript?

- You hate typing `div` tags.
- You believe ‚Äúdesign is just vibes‚Äù.
- You want to feel like a **10x developer** without actually learning anything.
- You want to deploy a site in 5 minutes and spend the rest of the day tweeting about it.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install -g vibescript
```

**Note:** If you get an access error, try using `sudo`:
```bash
sudo npm install -g vibescript
```


You‚Äôll also need an **OpenAI API key**:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

---

## üõ† Usage

### Create a `.vibe` file

Check out the `example/App.vibe` file for a complete working example, or create your own:

```vibescript
component NavButton:
    "A glowing button that says 'Sign Up' in TailwindCSS."

component Navbar:
    "A minimalistic navbar with a logo on the left and the NavButton on the right."

component HeroSection:
    "Big bold headline saying 'Welcome to the Vibe'. Background is a gradient from pink to purple. Add a call-to-action button."

page HomePage:
    Navbar
    HeroSection
```

---

### Build Once

```bash
# Build the example app
vibe example/App.vibe

# Or build your own file
vibe MyApp.vibe
```

Outputs HTML to `dist/`.

---

### Hot Reload (Dev Mode)

```bash
# Start dev server with the example app
vibe example/App.vibe --watch

# Or with your own file
vibe MyApp.vibe --watch
```

- Starts a dev server at `http://localhost:3000`
- Injects a live reload script into your HTML
- Shows a **"‚ú® Building vibes..."** overlay while the AI generates
- Reloads automatically when done

---

### Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Deploy the example app
vibe example/App.vibe --deploy

# Or deploy your own
vibe MyApp.vibe --deploy
```

This will:
1. Build your vibes
2. Deploy `dist/` to Vercel
3. Make you feel like a 10x developer

---

## üß© Nested Components

VibeScript supports **recursive nesting**.  
Example:

```vibescript
component Icon:
    "A small SVG star icon."

component NavButton:
    "A glowing button that says 'Sign Up' with the Icon inside."

component Navbar:
    "A minimalistic navbar with a logo on the left and the NavButton on the right."

page HomePage:
    Navbar
```

The compiler will:
- Generate `Icon`
- Inject it into `NavButton`
- Inject `NavButton` into `Navbar`
- Inject `Navbar` into your page
- Ship it

## üß† Choosing Your OpenAI Model

VibeScript lets you choose which OpenAI LLM to use for generating your vibes. 

### Available Models:
- `gpt-5` ‚Äì Latest and most capable model for complex generation and the best UI. **Best quality, highest cost.**
- `gpt-4o` ‚Äì High-quality, multimodal model. **Good quality, high cost.**
- `gpt-4.1` ‚Äì Advanced reasoning and analysis capabilities. **Very good quality, moderate-high cost.**
- `gpt-4.1-mini` ‚Äì Faster, more cost-effective version of GPT-4.1. **Good quality, moderate cost.**
- `gpt-4.1-nano` ‚Äì Even faster, more cost-effective version of GPT-4.1-mini. **Basic quality, low cost.**
- `o3` ‚Äì OpenAI's reasoning-focused model. **Good quality, moderate cost.**
- `o4-mini` ‚Äì Smaller, faster reasoning model. **Basic quality, low cost.**
- `gpt-oss-120b` ‚Äì Open source model with 120B parameters. **Variable quality, very low cost.**
- `gpt-oss-20b` ‚Äì Open source model with 20B parameters. **Basic quality, very low cost.**

### Model Selection Guide:
- **Production/Professional Sites**: Use `gpt-5`, `gpt-4o`, or `gpt-4.1`
- **Personal Projects/Prototypes**: Use `gpt-4.1-mini` or `gpt-4.1-nano`
- **Budget-Conscious Development**: Use `o3` or `o4-mini`
- **Experimental/Open Source**: Use `gpt-oss-120b` or `gpt-oss-20b`

### Example:
```bash
vibe App.vibe --model gpt-5
```

This will:
- Use `gpt-5` for all component generation
- Produce higher quality, more polished websites
- Cache results separately per model (so switching models won't overwrite previous cache)
- Allow you to experiment with speed vs. quality trade-offs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

VibeScript can be configured via:
1. **Command-line flags** (e.g., `--model gpt-4o`)
2. **Optional config file** (`vibe.config.json`)

### Example `vibe.config.json`
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5",
  "port": 4000
}
```

- `model` ‚Äì Default OpenAI model to use for component generation. **Recommended: gpt-5 for best results.**
- `port` ‚Äì Port for the dev server in `--watch` mode.

### Priority:
1. Command-line flags (highest priority)
2. `vibe.config.json`
3. Built-in defaults (`gpt-4.1-mini` for model, `3000` for port)

### Example Usage:
```bash
# Uses model from config file
vibe example/App.vibe --watch

# Overrides config file with higher quality model
vibe example/App.vibe --model gpt-4o --port 5000

# Quick test with budget model
vibe example/App.vibe --model gpt-4.1-nano
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Prompt Parsing** ‚Äì VibeScript reads your `.vibe` file and extracts components and pages.
2. **Hashing & Caching** ‚Äì Each prompt is hashed. If unchanged, it‚Äôs pulled from `.vibecache.json`.
3. **AI Compilation** ‚Äì Prompts are sent to an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to generate HTML/CSS/JS.
4. **Recursive Resolution** ‚Äì If a component references another, it‚Äôs resolved first.
5. **Assembly** ‚Äì Components are stitched together into full HTML pages.
6. **Live Reload** ‚Äì A WebSocket server pushes reload events to your browser.
7. **Deployment** ‚Äì `--deploy` sends your vibes to Vercel.
